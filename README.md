# Battleship with React
Hello there people, I want to share with you my Battleship project, the classic board game, developed with React and CSS.

## Want to try it?
### Try it live
(waiting for the deployed project link)

### Get the repository for yourself
First of all, clone the repository to your local workspace:

```
Then, run the package installation command:

```
And finally run the following command to set up your own live server:
